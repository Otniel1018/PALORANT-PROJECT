        <p class="article">For weeks, agents have felt itâ€”something wasnâ€™t right.Matches felt off. Victory didnâ€™t feel earned. Defeat stung sharper than it should have. Some climbed without a fight. Others fell despite their brilliance. A fracture had formed in the foundations of the ranked system. And nowâ€¦ we fix it.
            <br><br>
            Patch 10.07.06 delivers a long-awaited Ranked Rollback, recalibrating the competitive ecosystem to its rightful state. This is more than a resetâ€”itâ€™s a realignment of skill, a fresh opportunity for those whoâ€™ve been caught in the chaos of an unstable climb.
            <br><br>
            ðŸŒ€ Ranked Rollback â€“ What It Means?<br>
            All players will see changes to their current ranks. Using revised matchmaking data, performance analytics, and hidden MMR evaluations, the system has rolled back recent ranked changes to restore balance. Some will drop. Some will rise. But all will start again with the confidence that this time, itâ€™s accurate.
            <br><br>
            The rollback affects matches recorded during a known destabilization window. Players who consistently performed well may see improvements. Those who benefited from system flaws will find their ranks rebalanced. This is about fairness, competition, and giving the grind the meaning it deserves.
            <br><br>
            And for those whoâ€™ve been sitting on the edge, waiting for a fixâ€”this is your moment.
            <br><br>
            ðŸ”§ Minor Bug Fixes â€“ Quiet, But Critical<br>
            Behind the scenes, a number of minor bugs have been squashed. Some fixes youâ€™ll notice immediately, others will simply make things feel smootherâ€”like they always shouldâ€™ve been.    
            Your voice has shaped this patch. And your gameplay will define whatâ€™s next.
            <br><br>
            So queue up. Play smart. Play sharp.<br>
            The Ranked climb has been restored. <br>
            This time, it's on your terms. <br>
            
            Welcome to Patch 10.07.06. Let the real battle begin.
